### Introduction
This is the Home Page for an ecommerce platform (Cosmetics Business). This is developed using React. Used Daisy UI + Tailwind as the CSS Framework for styling purpose. Responsive Design Princples are considered here so it can be viewed on small, medium and large screens without any compromise in the user experience. Pagination feature is implemented here so the user does not have to scroll endlessly to view the products. Used [Makeup API](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/) to get some dummy data to display.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
